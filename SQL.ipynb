        "2. Explain the purpose of constraints and how they help maintain data integrity in a database. Provide\n",
        "examples of common types of constraints.\n",
        "-> Constraints are rules applied to database columns to restrict the type of data that can be entered, thereby ensuring the accuracy, reliability, and consistency of the data (data integrity). They prevent invalid operations like inserting incomplete records, duplicate entries, or data that violates business rules. Common examples include NOT NULL (ensuring a column always has a value), UNIQUE (all values in a column are distinct), PRIMARY KEY (uniquely identifies each record, implicitly NOT NULL and UNIQUE), FOREIGN KEY (maintains relationships between tables), CHECK (ensures values meet specific conditions), and DEFAULT (sets a predefined value if none is provided).\n",
        "\n",
        "3. Why would you apply the NOT NULL constraint to a column? Can a primary key contain NULL values? Justify\n",
        "your answer.\n",
        "->You would apply the NOT NULL constraint to a column to ensure that every record in the table always contains a value for that specific column, guaranteeing data completeness and integrity. A primary key cannot contain NULL values because its fundamental purpose is to uniquely identify each row, and NULL values would violate this uniqueness and prevent reliable identification and referential integrity.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. Explain the steps and SQL commands used to add or remove constraints on an existing table. Provide an\n",
        "example for both adding and removing a constraint.\n",
        "-> To add or remove constraints on an existing table, you use the ALTER TABLE SQL command. To add a constraint, you typically use ALTER TABLE table_name ADD CONSTRAINT constraint_name CONSTRAINT_TYPE (column_name(s)), for example, ALTER TABLE employees ADD CONSTRAINT UQ_employees_email UNIQUE (email);. For NOT NULL or DEFAULT constraints, you modify the column directly: ALTER TABLE employees ALTER COLUMN emp_name SET NOT NULL; or ALTER TABLE employees ALTER COLUMN salary SET DEFAULT 30000.00;. To remove a constraint, you use ALTER TABLE table_name DROP CONSTRAINT constraint_name, for example, ALTER TABLE employees DROP CONSTRAINT UQ_employees_email;. For NOT NULL or DEFAULT, it's ALTER TABLE employees ALTER COLUMN emp_name DROP NOT NULL; or ALTER TABLE employees ALTER COLUMN salary DROP DEFAULT;. These commands allow you to modify a table's structure to enforce data integrity rules or to relax them as needed.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. Explain the consequences of attempting to insert, update, or delete data in a way that violates constraints.\n",
        "Provide an example of an error message that might occur when violating a constraint.\n",
        "-> Attempting to insert, update, or delete data in a way that violates database constraints will cause the operation to fail, preventing the invalid data from being stored and thus maintaining data integrity. The database system will reject the transaction and return an error message, such as ERROR: new row for relation \"employees\" violates check constraint \"employees_age_check\" when trying to insert an employee with an age below the minimum allowed by a CHECK constraint.\n",
        "\n",
        "6.  You created a products table without constraints as follows:\n",

        "    product_name VARCHAR(50),\n",
        "    price DECIMAL(10, 2));\n",
        "Now, you realise that?\n",
        ": The product_id should be a primary keyQ\n",
        ": The price should have a default value of 50.00\n",
        "\n",
        "-> To modify your existing products table, you can first add a primary key constraint to the product_id column to ensure unique identification for each product. Then, you can set a default value of 50.00 for the price column, so any new product added without a specified price will automatically have this value.\n",
        "\n",
        "ALTER TABLE products\n",
        "ADD PRIMARY KEY (product_id);\n",
        "\n",
